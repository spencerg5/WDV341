	<h2>Version Control Software</h2>
<p>A version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It tracks changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.</p>
<h2>Add</h2>
<p>Add is when you would want to create a new remote. </p>
<h2>Commit</h2>
<p>A commit is a change to a file just like if you were to save a file. They usually have a commit message that shows what changes were made.</p>
<h2>Push</h2>
<p>A push is when you send your committed changes to a remote repository. If you were to make changes you would want to push your file so others would have a up to date one. </p>
<h2>Pull</h2>
<p>A pull is when you bring in the changes to a file and bring it to yours. If someone were to make changes to a file you both were working on, you would want to "pull" the changes so your file is up to date.</p>
<h2>Clone</h2>
<p>A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere. With your clone you can edit your files in an editor and use git to save your changes without having to be online. </p>
